            Hello! My name is William Anastasopoulos, and I am a fourth year Economics Major at Northeastern University with a Data Science minor! I am a highly motivated individual who takes great pride in the work I put forth, both in and out of the classroom. At Northeastern, I enjoy being part of the support staff of the baseball team as a student manager. In this role, I am responsible for a variety of tasks, such as scouting future opponents, data collection, and facilitation of player development. During my tenure as a Student Manager, the team has been extremely successful, winning a program record 44 games in 2023, and bringing home the Baseball Beanpot for the first time in 11 years in 2024. I am looking forward to the 2025 season and continuing this forward momentum!

            Personally, I am a huge Boston sports fan, with the Red Sox being my favorite team of the bunch. I have followed them religiously since I was 6 years old, and love to get out to games at Fenway Park each summer! In my free time, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, playing video games (I am currently big into EA College Football 25), and playing with my dog.

            Professionally, I am currently pursuing my second Co-op, and am open to any and all opportunities! Please feel free to reach out via Email or LinkedIn (both linked below)!
