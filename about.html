    <h2> More About Me! </h2>

    <p>
<h6>
    One of my favorite hobbies, especially during the Fall/Winter, is playing Fantasy Football with my friends! I have done a league with my friends from High School for the past 5 years, allowing for us to keep in touch as we attend college in various different parts of the country! To those unfamiliar with what Fantasy Football is, to objective is to create the best team of NFL players possible, with their on-field performance in NFL games dictating your success. Each team is comprised of 1 Quarterback, 2 Running backs, 2 Wide Receivers, 1 Tight End, 1 "FLEX" (can be a running back, wide receiver, or tight end), 1 Defense/Special Teams, 1 Kicker, and 7 Bench players of their choosing. Points are scored based on on-field performance, with .1 points for each yard, 6 points for a touchdown, 1 point for each reception, and -2 points for each fumble. For quarterbacks, it is a little different, with .04 points for each yard (1 point/25 yards), 4 points for a passing TD, 6 points for a rushing TD, and -2 points for each interception/fumble. As a fan of the NFL, Fantasy Football allows for me to keep track of what goes on within the league, while also having fun with my friends! While it can get competitive, I greatly enjoy it and look forward to the Fall because of it!    </p></h6>
